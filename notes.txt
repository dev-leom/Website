fix nav bar:


A quick note as well, since you are using hooks inside the link map what you are essentially doing is 
recreating a component for every render. Which is usually fine, if the list is not dynamic, but 
I'm suspecting that the hooks will be called out of order if the list changes, which could cause weird side effects. 
You could fix it by moving the map function out of the component, as a separate component, 
and then just render that component in the map with a key. 
I could be wrong though, could be something special about the motion hooks that allow them to be called like that.
